# Binoculars

Binoculars is your debug assistant for Rails. It gives you a real-time dashboard of requests and responses so you can spot issues, trace activity, and understand your appâ€™s behavior without leaving the browser.

It helps developers capture request/response data and view them in a simple dashboard, right inside their Rails app. Perfect companion for your Rails development environment.
